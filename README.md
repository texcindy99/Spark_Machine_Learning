## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You need to install pyspark to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.6 and Spark version 2.4.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is a Spark machine learning project. I was interestested in using customer data of a digital music service to predict custome churn by the following steps:

1. Load, clean and wrangle the data using Spark SQL;
2. Create machine learning model to predict customer churn using Spark ML;
3. Optimize model by hyper parameter tuning.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is one data file of 237 MB used in the notebook. "medium-sparkify-event-data.json is the data file for user log of Spartify music service.

The data file is available for Udacity Data Science Nano Degree students [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/December/5c1d6681_medium-sparkify-event-data/medium-sparkify-event-data.json).
